# Frequency Word Analyzer - Backend

## Overview

This project is a backend implementation for a Frequency Word Analyzer REST API. It takes a plain text file from an AWS S3 bucket, analyzes the word frequencies, and returns the top K most frequent words.


## Prerequisites

Before getting started with the Frequency Word Analyzer Backend, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

* **Java 17**: The application is built with Java 17. You can download and install it from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) or use a compatible OpenJDK distribution.

* **Docker Desktop**: Docker is used for simulating AWS services and other dependencies. Install Docker Desktop from the [official Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

Make sure to have these prerequisites in place before proceeding with the setup and usage of the application.

## Technologies Used

* Java 17 - LTS version of java currently supporting to generate springboot application
* Spring Boot 3.3.2 (Latest stable version) - Simplifies the development of production-ready applications.
* AWS SDK for Java - Provides Java APIs for AWS services, used for S3 interaction.
* Springdoc OpenAPI - Generates OpenAPI documentation for the API.
* Lombok - Reduces boilerplate code in Java.
* JUnit 5 - Testing framework for Java.
* Mockito - Mocking framework for unit tests.
* AssertJ - Fluent assertions library for Java.
* Testcontainers - Provides lightweight, throwaway instances of AWS services.

## Spring Boot Features

* **spring-boot-starter-web**: Starter for building web, including RESTful, applications using Spring MVC.
* **spring-boot-starter-cache**: Starter for using Spring Frameworkâ€™s caching support.
* **spring-boot-starter-validation**: Starter for using Java Bean Validation with Hibernate Validator.
* **spring-boot-starter-security**: Starter for using Spring Security.

## Setup


### Clone the repository:

   SSH

   ```shell
   
   git@github.com:DeepuGeorgeJacob/FreqWord.git
   
   ```
   
   Or (HTTP)
   
   ```shell
   
   https://github.com/DeepuGeorgeJacob/FreqWord.git
   
   ```
   
   Or (Git Cli)
   
   ```shell
    gh repo clone DeepuGeorgeJacob/FreqWord
   ```
### Configure AWS in Docker - Local AWS cloud  (Optional If you are not using AWS S3 Bucket from the AWS Cloud)

If you have simulated AWS in a Docker image instead of using AWS directly, follow these steps:

* Start your Docker Desktop application.
* Navigate to the localstack-script folder using the command:
    ```shell
    cd aws/localstack-script
    ```
* Make the `script.sh` executable.

    ```
    chmod +x script.sh
    ```
* Run docker containers. To do that follow the below command
    ``` shell
    docker-compose up
    ```
* Go back to root project file
    ```shell
    cd ../..
    ```

## Configure AWS CLI

**Step 1: Install AWS CLI**

Make sure you have the AWS CLI installed on your machine. You can download and install it from the [official AWS CLI website](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).

**Step 2: Configure AWS CLI**

Open a terminal and run the following command:
```bash
    aws configure
  ```


This command will prompt you to enter the following information:

**AWS Access Key ID**: Your AWS access key.<br>
**AWS Secret Access Key**: Your AWS secret key.<br>
**Default region name**: The AWS region where your S3 bucket is located, Please use `eu-central-1` for this project.<br>
**Default output format**: You can leave this blank or choose a format (e.g., json).

**Step 3: Add AWS-related properties to your `application.properties` file**

It's important to note that storing AWS credentials directly in your `application.properties` file is not recommended for production environments. Instead, consider using environment variables or a secure configuration manager.

Here's an example of how you might structure your application.properties file:

```properties
    aws.accessKey=freqword
    aws.secretKey=freqword
    aws.bucket.name=freqwordbucket
    aws.s3.service.endpoint=http://s3.localhost.localstack.cloud:4566/
```

Replace `Your AWS Access Key ID` and `Your AWS Secret Access Key` with your actual AWS credentials.

**Step 4: Copy Files to S3 Bucket**

Now that your AWS CLI is configured, you can use the `aws s3 cp` command to copy files to an S3 bucket. The basic syntax is as follows:
```shell
  aws s3 cp <local-file-path> s3://<bucket-name>/<destination-path> --endpoint-url <url>
```

* `local-file-path`: The path to the file on your local machine.
* `bucket-name`: The name of your S3 bucket. In our case it should be `freqwordbucket`.
* `destination-path`: The path within the S3 bucket where you want to store the file.

For example, to copy a file named example.txt from your local machine to an S3 bucket named `freqwordbucket`:

```shell
  aws s3 cp example.txt s3://freqwordbucket --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566
```

I have added some files to our AWS folder. You can run the script to copy the files into AWS. 

Ensuring `copy_files_to_s3.sh` is executable.
```shell
  chmod +x ./aws/copy_files_to_s3.sh
```

Copy file to s3 bucket
```shell
  sh ./aws/copy_files_to_s3.sh
```

## Build and Run


To build the application, run the following command:
```shell
  ./gradlew build
```

This will compile the source code, run tests, and generate the executable JAR file.

To run the application, use the following command:
```shell
  java -jar build/libs/analyser-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Ensure that you have Java installed on your machine. The application will be accessible at http://localhost:2000.

## API Documentation
Swagger documentation is available at http://localhost:2000/swagger-ui/index.html.

## Authentication and Request making


The application requires authentication to access certain endpoints. Use the following credentials:

**Username:** user <br>
**Password:** password <br>

**Example Usage:** Make a POST Request<Br>

To make a POST request to the frequency word analysis endpoint:

URL: http://localhost:2000/freq/word

Request Body

Include the following JSON payload in the request body:

```json
{
    "fileName": "3503.txt",
    "k": 5
}
```
* "fileName": The name of the text file to be analyzed.
* "k": The number of top words to retrieve.


**Example Response**

Upon a successful request, you will receive a JSON response containing the top K most frequent words along with their frequencies. For example:

 ```json
{
    "the": 70,
    "of": 56,
    "to": 56,
    "you": 47,
    "or": 43
}
```
